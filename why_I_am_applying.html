        <p1 class="whyAmIApplyingParagraphs" > <b>I am very excited to be applying for the Founders and Coders programme and to submit this website for your review.</b> Thank you in advance for reading, I hope you'll find my background interesting! <br><br>

            I first encountered coding while studying Mathematics at University College London (UCL) and started using Wolfram Mathematica in order to get solutions to what looked like un-solvable differential equations and eventually to geometrically visualise such solutions for further mathematical analysis. I quickly realised its potential and decided to study Mathematica and Python in more depth by attending summer courses offered by the University. <br> 
            While studying, I worked as a Maths tutor at Dunraven Sixth Form College (Streatham Hill, London) where I helped students struggling with Maths prepare for their A-levels exams and students excelling in their courses prepare for University. It was an incredible experience for me as I realised how satisfying and exciting teaching is and how much one can learn when trying to explain intricate concepts as simply as possible.  </p1>
        <p1 class="whyAmIApplyingParagraphs" style="justify-self: end;">When I completed my studies, I started working as a finance assistant at Fluidly, a fast growing FinTech start-up in London, where I was introduced to the exciting world of tech and exposed to the frenetic and tireless life of a start-up. 
            In particular, the bewildering work being done around the desks of the engineering team caught my attention and sparked my interest in web development and especially front-end engineering. <br>
            Indeed, in April last year I started studying Python and Javascript in my spare time and decided to move up a gear when realising how passionate I was.<br>
            Moreover, applying for this course has given me the opportunity to practice coding in weekly remote group sessions along with other applicants. I soon realised not only how different coding in a group is with respect to coding by yourself, but also how cooperating environments stimulate new and original ways of solving problems. In fact, <b>I am confident that as a programmer I will benefit and thrive in the peer-led learning environment this programme has to offer.</b>
            </p1>
        <p1 class="whyAmIApplyingParagraphs">Lastly, <b>I am thrilled at the idea of being part of the Founders and Coders community.</b> I resonate deeply with the principles and enthusiasm of the programme and, having been brought up in a household with strong female presence and having worked and lived in several European countries as a foreigner, I understand how intrinsic discrimination is to so many aspects of life, especially in the work-place. 
            I aim at having an insightful understanding on how society uses technology and consumes information and making sure that progress is made in a socially responsible manner. <br>
<b>I believe that this course would be a great step towards acquiring the skills I need to have an impact on the tech world and more generally to leave this world a better place than when I found it.</b></p1>
