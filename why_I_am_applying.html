            I first encountered coding while studying Mathematics at University and started using Wolfram Mathematica in order to obtain solutions to complex equations and to geometrically visualise such solutions for further analysis. I quickly realised its potential and decided to study in more depth Mathematica and Python by attending summer courses offered by the University.  
            When I completed my studies, I started working as a finance assistant at Fluidly, a fast growing FinTech start-up in London, where I was introduced to the exciting world of tech and exposed to the frenetic and tireless life of a start-up. 
            In particular, the bewildering work being done around the desks of the engineering team caught my attention and sparked my interest in web development. </p1>

        <p1 style="border: 0.1em solid transparent; height:150px; width: 80%; text-align: left; font-size: 15px; padding-left: 0.5%">Lastly, I am thrilled at the idea of being part of the Founders and Coders community. I resonate deeply with the principles and enthusiasm of the programme and, having been brought up in a household with strong female presence and having worked and lived in several European countries, I understand how intrinsic discrimination is to so many aspects of life, especially in the work-place. 
            I aim at having an insightful understanding on how society uses technology and consumes information and I believe that this course would be a great step towards acquiring the skills I need to have an impact on the tech world and more generally to leave this world a better place than when I found it.</p1>
